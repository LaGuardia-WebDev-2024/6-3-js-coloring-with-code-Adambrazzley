## Directions 
### Step #1 - Color the sky! <br>
We've drawn a snowperson on a sunny day, and you'll add color to this drawing so that the snowperson knows how sunny it really is!         
<br>
Start off by using the  `background()`  command <b> on line 4 </b> to change the color of the sky (Blue might be a nice color to use).      
<br>
### Step #2 - Color the ground! <br>
Use the  `fill()`  command to change the color of the ground (Green might be a nice color to use).      
<br>
Remember that, you'll need the  `fill()`  command to come before the  `rect()`  command that draws the ground. Don't worry if the color of the other shapes changes too, you'll fix them later!
<br>
### Step #3 - Color the ground! <br>
Now, add another  `fill()`  command to change the color of the sun (Orange or yellow might be nice colors to use). Don't worry if the color of the snowperson changes too, you'll fix him next!     
<br>
### Step #4 - What about the snowperson!? <br>
Now, add another  `fill()`  command to change the color of the snowperson (White might be a nice color to use). All three parts of the snowperson's body should be one color, not three different colors, so you only need to add one  `fill()`  command for this step.
<br>
### Step #5 - Play! <br>
Add other elements to your snowperson scene.
